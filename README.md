Prototipo
=========

The objective of this project is show how
the prototypal concept of object oriented programation
can work almost in the way Javascript does, but isn't perfect basically
by the natural limitations of the PHP language.

> A prototypal interface is such that can act independient
> from any set or subset of classes to do especific tasks, but
> with the trouble about PHP data types, everything in Javascript or
> Ruby is an object, but in PHP does not.

In this case, the Prototipo object can load or unload several "methods"
through of using closures to be act within.

Requeriments
------------

Prototipo is strictly roots, was written in PHP 5.3+ and all
related examples are written by the same way.
